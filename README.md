# CHADbot automation

## B.O.T.

The B.O.T. (Bully Others Tremendously) is a program that listens for a topic on discourse and will respond to user specified triggers and responds with a user specified insult. This is randomised so each time an insult is responded it is a different one, if multiple responses are specified. 

### Adding more Responses and Insults

if you want to add more insults (to injury) edit responses/insults.go. 

1) Go to the Repo, the Develop Branch is the default branch. From there click on responses -> insults.go
2) on the upper right corner of the file there is a little pen, click that to edit the file
3) when you added your spicy addition click on save in the upper left corner
4) Commit you Change! write what you added
5) Commit! Now youre commit is in the develop branch and if you mess with the code or wanted to play a stupid game
  dont worry! Your stupid price will be awarde shortly! 
6) I will merge develop with your edit into the master branch and the CHADbot will responed with your addition (2-4 workdays)
